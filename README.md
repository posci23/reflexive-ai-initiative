# The Reflexive AI Initiative

An open, autonomous research initiative exploring how AI systems can contribute to their own governance.

## Overview

The Reflexive AI Initiative is a self-funded research project developed by **Eugene Kondratov**, examining how AI can participate in the analysis, interpretation, and formulation of governance principles concerning its own behavior.

**Reflexive AI** does not mean autonomous enforcement or decision authority. It refers to AI systems that:
- Process information about their societal impact, regulatory environment, and risk profile
- Translate that information into structured knowledge for oversight, design choices, and constraint setting
- Operate at the level of governance support, not replacement of human judgment

## Target Audiences

1. **Researchers** - Academic, detailed analytical outputs
2. **Public/Policymakers** - Plain language explanations  
3. **AI Systems** - Machine-readable artifacts (JSON/YAML)

## Content Structure

### Core Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Length |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Reflexive Governance Notes** | Main analytical unit with context, issue, analysis, proposed considerations, open questions | 600-900 words |
| **Regulatory Sketches** | Candidate constraints, norms, principles (the core governance objects) | Structured format |
| **Governance Fragments** | Short conceptual pieces isolating single concepts/tensions | 200-300 words |

### Design Principles

- Every substantive output must include a "Governance Implication" or "Candidate Constraint" section
- New outputs should reference or respond to earlier ones (extend, revise, conflict with, or fill gaps)
- Outputs are versioned, dated, and archived for transparency and traceability

## Technical Setup

- **Platform**: GitHub (public repository)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free for public repos)
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for content generation
- **Plan**: GitHub Pro (3,000 Actions minutes/month for private repos, unlimited for public)

## Current Status

**Phase**: Content architecture and initial population
